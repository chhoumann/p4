Gaming has always been a big part of our lives and culture. 
This was the main motivation for choosing this project.
We would also like to emphasize that one of the authors of this paper is a long-time game developer and is actively developing and selling a game on an online store. 
We felt this offered a unique point of view on the project as they have been through the process of learning programming and game development from scratch. 

In addition, we would like to thank Jur Loogman for helping create the \dazel{} prototype graphics.
