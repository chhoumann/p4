\chapter*{Preface}

Writing a compiler is sort of a 'rite of passage'. In doing so, you gain a tremendous respect for the tools you use on a day-to-day basis. It is easy to take these for granted; 'it just works,' you say. While certain aspects of writing a compiler seem trivial, others are, at least initially, overwhelmingly complex.

This is what we have realized after coming to the journey's end. The shoulders you stand on are often broader than you think.

Embarking on this journey, we set out to create a better learning experience for new programmers. ``\textit{Learn how to program by creating games!}'' is the promise we made.

Partly, we believe that we succeeded in fulfilling it. There were many challenges along the way. Some of them came from not knowing what we did not know, and some of them from thinking we knew something we did not.

We would not have gone nearly as far had it not been for the help we have received along the way. Our gratitude goes to our supervisor, Giorgio Bacci, our professors, and everyone else who helped us. We also want to extend thanks to Jur Loogman for his generous help in creating art for \dazel{}. Lastly, to the authors of the tools we used. Thank you.

This report documents what we have learned along the way, and we welcome you to embark on the journey with us.
