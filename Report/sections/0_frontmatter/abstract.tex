The motivation for this project is to make game development and programming more accessible to beginners.
This report covers the design and implementation of the \dazel{} programming language.
We describe the process of designing the language based on research and our own experiences and preferences.
This includes designing the syntax using a context free grammar and formalizing the semantics.

To implement this, we started by generating a parser based on the formal grammar specification using Antlr.
This gave us the foundation for implementing the subsequent phases of the \dazel{} compiler including building an abstract syntax tree, performing semantic analysis and generating intermediate models. 
Finally, we implemented an interpreter that interprets these models and generates the final result using the Unity game engine.
Along the way, we have performed several different types of tests to verify the correctness of our implementation.

The end product is a simple language, functional compiler and a simple prototype for generating top-down adventure games.
