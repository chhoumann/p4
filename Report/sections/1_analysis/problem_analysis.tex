Learning how to code is hard. It is no wonder that the most viewed video on YouTube for the search term '\textit{learn programming}' has been viewed 23 million times\cite{LearnProgrammingYouTube}. The video concerns itself with \textit{Python}, a language that is regarded as easy to learn for beginners\cite{PythonBeginners}.

A common error, and source of frustration, for new programmers is syntax errors. Other issues are types and confusing error outputs \cite{bosseWhyProgrammingDifficult2017}.

New programmers also have difficulties with the application of programming concepts. This could be because learning isn't practical enough\cite{lahtinenStudyDifficultiesNovice2005}. To learn how to program, you have to program.

Is a simple language, like Python, then, salvation for these new programmers? Research indicates that it just might be. A simple language gives rise to fewer syntax errors as well as logic errors. Research also tells us that learning a simpler language does not hinder the learner when moving to a more complex language\cite{mannilaWhatSimpleLanguage2006}.
