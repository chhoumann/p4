Target demographic

Based on the previous section we have decided that our target group will be beginners of programming. Beginners in this sense are people of arbitrary age with the primary condition being that they have an interest in learning how to program.
The choice of this target group is based on the fact that these are the people that we think stand to gain the most from research and developments into programming languages that cater to this group.
