\chapter{Learning} \label{chap:analysis}


There are various factors, ways and methods for how humans can learn something effectively. 
This section will focus on how developing a game, can be a good way for new programmers to start programming and a better way for them to learn it as well.\newline

One key factor in order to learn something effectively is through deliberate practice (deliberate practice). The term \emph{deliberate practice} is refered to as when an "individual intentionally repeats an activity in order to improve performance". 
This means in order for new programmers to effectively learn to code, it is not enough to simply view/listen to a tutorial on programming, nor is it enough to rotely repeat a given task over and over again. Instead it indcludes deliberate practice for the learning individual. This requires attention, rehearsal and repetition. 
In order to achieve these 3 things, one may look at the role of interest has, as this is also a very important thing for promoting effective learning. In a study on the importance of interest in education, interest can be defined as "both a psychological state of attention and affect toward a particular object or topic, and an enduring predisposition to reengage over time" (interest attention).
In other words, in order for new programmers to learn something effectively, it is first and foremost important that they practice deliberately. This requires attention, in which it is important for the new programmers to have an interest in what they are practicing. 
Secondly deliberate practice also required repetition. As mentioned in the above quote, interest plays an important role in this aspect as well, since interest can make it easier for programmers to repeatedly program more and more over time, while their attention and focus are being directed at the task at hand.\newline

In chapter... it can be seen that there are a lot of new programmers who gets into programming by developing/wanting to develop games. This means there is a big interest for game development and it is something more and more people want to get into. And as it was established in this section, interest plays an important role for promoting effective learning.
Game development can therefor be a very good way for people to learn progamming.
