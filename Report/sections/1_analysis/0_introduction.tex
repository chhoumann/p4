To the untrained eye, programming can seem like wizardry. Even the simplest aspects of programming may confuse people\cite{bosseWhyProgrammingDifficult2017}.

Many young people grow up playing video games and often grow interested in their development. 
This interest will naturally lead them to come across programming.
When first researching how to make games, you are met with a plethora of tools and programming languages that all argue that they are the right choice.
These tools are both mature and advanced, and so they can seem overwhelming to beginners. 
In addition, learning to use a game engine also means creating animations, art and much more which makes it an unsuitable place to first learn programming as it is just one part of game development.

With this in mind, we became interested in creating a basic environment which makes the introduction to programming and game development smoother, and which allows beginners to experiment with a primitive language that, despite being simple, features a syntax and flow similar to enterprise programming languages.
