\chapter{Scientific Research} \label{chap:analysis}
In this section, we discuss relevant scientific research on the difficulties of programming for beginners.
Later, we shall use this as a basis for various design decisions in our own language such that we can make more 
informed decisions about the language's syntax and semantics.

In an investigation by A. Stefik, S. Siebert, M. Stefik and K. Slattery from 2011, participants - all of whom were
programming novices - would use different programming languages to solve the same tasks so as to compare intuitiveness. 
It was concluded that keywords having names that directly alluded to their purpose was important to the novices. 
For example, the keyword \emph{repeat} was rated to be nearly seven times more intuitive to use than the keyword \emph{for}.

As language designers, such discoveries are important to take note of, as it emphasizes the importance of selecting intuitive for keywords.

A different investigation about children and programming by S. Papavlasopoulou, M. N. Giannakos and L. Jaccheri discovered that programming
stereotypes exist, even among children. In the study, it was found that many of the participating girls had no experience with programming
at all, and that they believed it to be an activity exclusively performed by "geeks". To remedy this prejudice, the authors had the children
develop storyboards in groups from which they would develop games using the Scratch programming language. This made the girls realize
the potential of storytelling by programming video games, and it helped motivate them to learn programming.

This study highlights the importance of presenting not just the mathematical aspect of programming to novices, but also 
showing them other uses, such as being able to develop entertainment. 
It also shows that being able to tell a story makes learning programming more engaging for beginners.
