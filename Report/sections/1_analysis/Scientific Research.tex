\chapter{Scientific Research} \label{chap:analysis}
In this section, we discuss relevant scientific research on the difficulties of programming for beginners.
Later, we shall use this as a basis for various design decisions in our own language such that we can make more 
informed decisions about the language's syntax and semantics.

In an investigation by A. Stefik, S. Siebert, M. Stefik and K. Slattery from 2011, participants - all of whom were
programming novices - would use different programming languages to solve the same tasks so as to compare intuitiveness. 
It was concluded that keywords having names that directly alluded to their purpose was important to the novices. 
For example, the keyword \emph{repeat} was rated to be nearly seven times more intuitive to use than the keyword \emph{for}.

As language designers, such discoveries are important to take note of, as it emphasizes the importance of selecting intuitive for keywords.
