\chapter{Discussion}
Our goal with this project was to design and implement a compiler for a programming language for beginners in the context of game development. 
This sections seeks to communicate the circumstances under which the project was developed as well as give insight into our thoughts about the end result.
We also wish to elaborate on specific decisions that we, in retrospect, feel were poor or overly ambitious.

\section{Ambitiousness}
A major challenge in the first half of the project that ended up impacting the project as a whole was that our original group had a difference in ambition. 
One half of the group had lower expectations which caused conflicts and limited the group work.
Much time was spent attemping to solve these conflicts and getting everyone to agree on how much effort and time to invest in the project.
This combined with the overall level of ambition meant that we fell behind as not much work was being done on the project for the first two months. 
Eventually, this resulted in the decision to split our group in two halves as we were unable to find an agreeable compromise.

Because we stuck to the original vision for the project despite having less time and a smaller group, we unfortunately ended up investing too much time into features that we realistically did not have time to implement such as member access.
Features like this and others were not part of the semester curriculum which therefore meant that we had no frame of reference to work from.

Furthermore, the consequence of the group split meant that we were unable to spend as much time as we would have liked on the game aspect of \dazel{}. 
Thus we ended with a relatively simple prototype, however we feel that, under the circumstances, this is a satisfying proof of concept.

\section{Learning Goals}
Part of the semester learning goals state that we should be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of all the phases of a compiler or interpreter. We feel that we succeded in achieving this, but in hindsight it is very clear that there are areas in which we, as previously mentioned, may have been too ambitious. 

One particular feature that stands out as an immense technical challenge has been the implementation of member access. A large part of the difficulty with this feature has been finding helpful literature on how one could go about implementing such a feature and as a result a lot of time was spent making a solution that worked as one would expect. The learning experience has been great, but because of the fact that such a feature does not contribute towards any of the semester learning goals, we feel that time may have been better spent on improving or implementing things that contribute more greatly towards those learning goals. 

Areas that may have been more fruitful to invest time into would have been the code generation phase of the compiler. Currently, we are only able to compile a few elements of our language into intermediate models, and we would have enjoyed having a more feature rich compiler that is able to handle control flow structures as well as boolean logic. This would have allowed us to construct games with a narative and action which is more in line with what we hoped to achieve.


- Frontend tools and learning
	- "udenfor pensum" i.e. member access, link checking and semantics for OOP principles
- Backend
	- We do not compile to bytecode, assembly, etc. - more to learn
	
\section{Criteria evalutation}
A primary goal for us has been to construct the language in a fashion that ensures that it has a high level of readability and writability, as the language is intended for beginners. In addition, we also focused on making the language syntactically similar to languages such as C\# to make the transition from \dazel{} to any of the modern, more feature rich languages easier. 





When taking a critical look at the language, we feel that we have succeeded in creating the foundation for these criteria to be met, as all the infrastructure is in place. 
The reality is, once again, that due to time constraints we have not been able to finish the implementation of many of the language constructs.
