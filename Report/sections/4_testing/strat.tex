Introduction to testing goes here.

\section{Testing Strategy}
\textbf{Automated testing} in which we used unit testing and integration testing to ensure correct program behavior by expecting specific results when using our methods and classes. 
Code coverage was calculated by the IDE used in the project, JetBrains Rider, so we did not need to use any external tools to measure this\cite{rider_test_coverage}.
The tests are also responsible for testing type and scope rules among other language design features in order to ensure that our implementation complies with the language specification.
