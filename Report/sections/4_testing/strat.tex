\chapter{Testing}

\textbf{Code coverage testing} in which we use unit testing and integration testing to ensure correct program behavior by expecting specific results when using our methods and classes. 
Code coverage is calculated by the IDE used in the project, JetBrains Rider, so we need not use any external tools to measure this\cite{rider_test_coverage}.
