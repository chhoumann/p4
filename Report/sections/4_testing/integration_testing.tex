\section{Integration Testing} \label{sec:IntTesting}
Once it has been verified that the individual parts of a program function correctly, it is crucial to assure that they are able to work together, too.
If one module changes, and it no longer works with other modules, it could be very resource-demanding to rectify it later.
Usually, the earlier such errors are caught, the less 'expensive' they are.
In order to test that modules work together, one could do integration testing.

Our approach to integration testing has been testing the entire compiler. We have opted to test every phase at once. This is also the scenario users are in, so it made sense to test that specific case.

One could also test how individual phases work together with the next. We did not opt to do this. We rely on our logging system, described in \ref{ErrorHandling}, to give us descriptive error logs in case these tests fail.

In particular, we wrote two tests for the \dazel{} compiler. The first test tests verify that important language features work, and that no errors are thrown as the source code is processed. This test can be seen in \snipref{lst:integrationTest1}. The second test, seen in \snipref{lst:integrationTest2}, tests that some invalid source code does not get processed.

This concludes the section for how testing was done for \dazel{}. In the following section we will reflect on our project.
