\section{Semantics for Dazel}

In this section we will be presenting, in an informal manner, the semantics of \dazel.
Firstly, we will present the type rules which is then followed by a presentation of the scope rules.

\subsection*{Type checking}

When designing a compiler, decisions have to be made concerning how you approach type checking. Type checking can be divided into two categories, each of which have
drawbacks and benefits. The categories are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Strong} versus \textbf{Weak} types
	\item \textbf{Static} versus \textbf{Dynamic} types
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Strong and weak typing}
Strong and weak typing relates to how the type of a given variable can be determined at either run time or compile time. Strong typing implies that the compiler is
able to detect all the incorrect uses of variables that would otherwise result in type errors or illegal coercions.
Weak typing implies that types will automically be converted from one type to another or that type rule enforcement can easily be subverted.
For example, using a string in a numeric context will convert it to the string's numerical representation.

\subsubsection*{Static and dynamic typing}
Static typing means that the type is statically bound to the \emph{variable} and that types are checked at compile time.
In contrast dynamic typing is where the type is bound to the \emph{value} and that the type is checked at run time.


\subsection*{Type rules}
\dazel has implicitly declared strong types.
This means the programmer does not need to explicitly define the type of every variable, however, once declared, a variable
cannot dynamically change type.
For example, as can be seen in \ref{lst:IllegalAssignment}, \textbf{Exit1} is declared to be of type \textbf{Exit} so it cannot be be
assigned to an integer afterwards.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of an illegal assingment}, label={lst:IllegalAssignment},escapechar=|]
// ./Screens/SampleScreen1.txt
Screen SampleScreen1 
{
	Exits 
	{
		Exit1 = Exit([4, 0], SampleScreen2.Exit1);
		Exit1 = 1; // Not legal because Exit1 has type Exit
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The decision to use this system is based on the fact that strongly typed languages offer greater safety, however being required to
specify the type of each variable as part of its declaration is often confusing to beginners as mentioned in \secref{sec:scientific_research}.
Therefore it was decided to go with a hybrid approach.

\subsection*{Type checking}

Because \dazel is a strongly typed language, and the goal is to offer safety and ease of use, we decided to perform type checking at compile time - that is, to make it
statically typed.
