\section{Design evaluation} \label{chap:design evaluation}
What is significant about developing a language is to carefully consider various parameters concerning the language itself and setting up essential criteria for the programming language. 
Therefore, it is crucial to be able to evaluate the different parameters using different tools. Therefore we chose to use an existing table from \cite{sebesta_concepts_2016} which covers the most important criteria for setting up a programming language. 

\fig{0.8}{Design_Criteria}{Table about design criteria.}

Simplicity is about keeping the language readable and easily understandable. A large number of constructs and features in a language will harm its simplicity and make it more diifficult to learn.

Orthogonality describes how many different ways primitive constructs can be combined. High orthogonality means that primitive constructs in a language can be combined in many different ways. 

Data types represent the different types that can be worked with in the language. For example, including a boolean data type makes boolean expressions more readable as one can use the keywords \texttt{true} and \texttt{false} as opposed to numeric values like 0 and 1.

Syntax design is a broad concept within the language, which can be the actual use of unique and reserved words.
Abstraction support is the precise handling of the code's reuse in the language itself without repeating the code writing.

Expressiveness is the very meaning of ways one can write down different operations in the language. Being able to make them simple to write down helps make the language better and more readable.

Type checks are used to be able to test type errors that could appear in the program. This can be done by either the the compiler intercepting it or when the program is running. There can be many different type checks in a programming language. It helps detecting faults in good time and solve them quickly.

Exception handling helps to detect errors that could occur while running the program. Additionally, it provides a good overview of how mistakes could have happened, and it helps to find out how they can be resolved.

Aliasing comes from naming several different names, which you then have access to at the same memory cell.




\subsection{Readability}
Readability is one of the most important criteria for the language itself, as it is intended for beginners in programming. 
Therefore, the language must be set up, and only the most valuable data types have been used to set it up. It is also important for the language itself that the syntax setup is well thought out to create minor confusion for beginners.
 This is done by keeping the orthogonality low, and the special words will be turned into reserved words to increase readability. 
Setting specific words as reserved words helps define particular designs in the program, allowing the language to be more readable.

\subsection{Writability}

The writability of the language is also an essential part of making it easy for the beginner to prepare programs with reduced problems. 
This is prevented by the high simplicity of the setup of the language and the simplification of the data types, which helps to make the syntax simpler to write down.
 Also, the expressiveness of the language itself will be set up to lie between visual programming and a high-level language.

 \subsection{Reliability}
 The language's reliability deals with how the language works under different circumstances and how well it works. 
 As the table shows, all the parameters help to influence the reliability of the language itself.
