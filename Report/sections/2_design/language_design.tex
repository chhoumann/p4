\chapter{Language design}\label{chap:language_design}
This chapter details the design of \dazel. In the specification of \dazel{} in \figref{dazel_specification}, it was decided that the language should promote practical learning while providing visual feedback to the written code. On the account of this, the \dazel{} language will be designed as an interpreted language used to build video games.

\section{Language design}
To start designing the programming language, we set out to specify a minimum viable product (MVP). We decided to start small but with expansion in mind.
