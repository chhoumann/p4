\chapter{Language design}
This chapter details the design of \dazel.

It was decided to develop a language inspired by the game "the Legend of Zelda: Linkâ€™s Awakening" into the programming language, as it is a familiar game with basic game terminologies.
This helps to set a framework for what the program language should be capable of.
In addition, "Unity" has been used as a program to test different functions to find out what could work well for the program language.

\section{Language design}

To start designing the programming language, we set out to specify a minimum viable product (MVP). We decided to start small but with expansion in mind.
