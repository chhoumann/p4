\chapter{Language design}
This chapter details the design of \dazel.
The language is intended to be a transitional language from visual programming to high-level language. Based on the problem analysis, it has been possible to specify the design for the user.
The target group is beginners in programming who are younger people. Therefore a programming language to make computer games has been built. This has been chosen as young people can relate more to video games as their hobby. \fxfatal{Kunne godt uddybes en del:
    "This has been chosen as young people can relate more to video games as their hobby" - skrev vi ikke lidt om det her i starten? måske lidt at hente derfra.
    Men i hvert fald en kilde på at understøtte påstanden. - John's review on PR}
This will help them to understand the principles of how a game should work more easily, and therefore be able to start programming. \fxfatal{Maybe give an example of what principles? - John's review on PR}
It was decided to develop a language inspired by the game "the Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening" into the programming language, as it is a familiar game with basic game terminologies.
This helps to set a framework for what the program language should be capable of.
In addition, "Unity" has been used as a program to test different functions to find out what could work well for the program language.

\section{Language design}

To start designing the programming language, we set out to specify a minimum viable product (MVP). We decided to start small but with expansion in mind.

\section{Semantics for Dazel}

In this section we will be presenting, in an informal manner, the semantics of \dazel. 
Firstly, we will present the type rules which is then followed by a presentation of the scope rules.



\subsection*{Type rules}
\dazel has implicitly declared strongly types.
This means the programmer does not need to explicitly define the type of every variable, however, once declared, a variable
cannot dynamically change type.
For example, as can be seen in \ref{lst:IllegalAssignment}, \textbf{Exit1} is declared to be of type \textbf{Exit} so it cannot be be
assigned to an integer afterwards.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of an illegal assingment}, label={lst:IllegalAssignment},escapechar=|]
// ./Screens/SampleScreen1.txt
Screen SampleScreen1 
{
	Exits 
	{
		Exit1 = Exit([4, 0], SampleScreen2.Exit1);
		Exit1 = 1; // Not legal because Exit1 has type Exit
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The decision to use this system is based on the fact that strongly typed languages offer greater safety, however being required to
specify the type of each variable as part of its declaration is often confusing to beginners as mentioned \secref{sec:scientific_research}.
Therefore it was decided to go with a hybrid approach.
