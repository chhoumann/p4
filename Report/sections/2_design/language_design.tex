\chapter{Language design}
This chapter details the design of \dazel.
The language is intended to be a transitional language from visual programming to high-level language. Based on the problem analysis, it has been possible to specify the design for the user.
The target group is beginners in programming who are younger people. Therefore a programming language to make computer games has been built. This has been chosen as young people can relate more to video games as their hobby. \fxfatal{Kunne godt uddybes en del:
    "This has been chosen as young people can relate more to video games as their hobby" - skrev vi ikke lidt om det her i starten? måske lidt at hente derfra.
    Men i hvert fald en kilde på at understøtte påstanden. - John's review on PR}
This will help them to understand the principles of how a game should work more easily, and therefore be able to start programming. \fxfatal{Maybe give an example of what principles? - John's review on PR}
It was decided to develop a language inspired by the game "the Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening" into the programming language, as it is a familiar game with basic game terminologies.
This helps to set a framework for what the program language should be capable of.
In addition, "Unity" has been used as a program to test different functions to find out what could work well for the program language.

\section{Language design}

To start designing the programming language, we set out to specify a minimum viable product (MVP). We decided to start small but with expansion in mind.

\section{Semantics for Dazel}

In this section we will be presenting, in an informal manner, the semantics of \dazel. Firstly, we will present the type rules which is then followed by a presentation
of the scope rules.
