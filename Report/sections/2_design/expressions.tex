\subsection{Expressions}
A major part of any programming language is expressions of which there are several types.
In the following, we will introduce these and discuss their relevance to \dazel{}.

\subsubsection*{Arithmetic expressions}
Arithmetic expressions are basic mathematical expressions. 
They consist of operators, operands, and function calls. 
Operators can either be unary, binary or ternary meaning they have either one, two or three operands.
Finally, binary operators are usually infix, meaning they appear between operands.

\subsubsection*{Operator evaluation order}


\subsubsection*{Relational expressions}


\subsubsection*{Boolean expressions}

\subsubsection*{Expressions in \dazel{}}
\dazel{} features a variety of binary operators to support arithmetic as well as unary operations for boolean expressions.
