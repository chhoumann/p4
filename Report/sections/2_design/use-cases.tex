\section{Make easy and pretty use cases}
It might be convenient to be able to make use cases in your report. On \ucref{uc:foo} you can find an example.

\usecase{Show foo}
        {uc:foo}
        {Show foo is initiated by a user, when the user selects bar. This action will result in foo being shown.}
        {Foo, Bar}
        {Get foo data}
        {The show foo use case}
