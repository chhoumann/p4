In the following, we will describe how one can use a structural operational semantics to define a transitions system for a language - that is, we are only concerned with the behavior of a program.
We will then use this to give a formal definition of the semantics for \dazel{}.

\section{Big- and small-step semantics}
Big- and small-step semantics are two different kinds of operational semantics used describe computations.
Given a single transition y --> y', big-step semantics describes the entire computation where y is the start configuration and y' must be a terminal configuration. 
In contrast, a small semantics describes only a single step in a larger computation in which y' does not need to be a terminal configuration.
