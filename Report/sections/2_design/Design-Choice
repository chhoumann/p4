\section{Design choice}


The language is intended to be a transitional language from visual programming to high-level language. Based on the problem analysis, it has been possible to specify the design for the user so that it hits the target group.
 The target group is beginners in programming who are younger people. Therefore a programming language to make computer games has been built. This has been chosen as young people can relate more to video games as their hobby. 
 This will help them to understand the principles of how a game should work more easily, and therefore be able to start programming. 
 It was decided to develop a language inspired by the game "the Legend of Zelda: Linkâ€™s Awakening" into the programming language, as it is a familiar game with basic game terminologies.
  This helps to set a framework for what the program language should be capable of.
 In addition, "Unity" has been used as a program to test different functions to find out what could work well for the program language.
