\section{Parse Generators}
Writing every part of the compiler by hand can be a lenghty process, therefore a tool has been used for fast and effective implemnation of the compiler's scanner and parser. When using a tool it is important to have a good understanding of the choosen generator. The quick implemnation allows us to test the grammar early in the designing phase.
There is a large amount of lexer and parse generators for various languages. In this section only the parse generators compatible with C# 
will be discussed. When choosing a parse generator there are several factors that comes into play, the parsing algorithm, the input grammar notation,
whether its compatible with an IDE and how easy it is to use and learn. Lots of parse generators fulfill the desired requirements, 
so choosing a more widely spread parse generator means having access to more resources to learn. Both Coco and ANTLR, are popular parse generators which use the LL (leftmost derivation), which means it parses the input from left to right. 
Also, they both takes EBNF notation as input grammar. They are both widely spread and lots of resources concerning these parsers are easy to access. \newline
We have chosen to use ANTLR4 for the parse generation because it is the most modern and used parse generator for c#, in contrast with Coco, ANTLR is very compatible with Visual studio code, which is the preferred IDE.
