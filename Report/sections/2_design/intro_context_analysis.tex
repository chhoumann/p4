\section{Contextual Analysis} \label{chap:contextual_analysis}

This section will describe what happens in the next phase of a compiler, 
after the source code has been parsed, which are contextual constraints.
The purpose of the contextual constraints is to give an informal 
specification of the scope and type rules, since the syntax rules by itself
are not enough to define a well-formed program. This section
will therefore describe what scope and type rules are, and what rules that have 
been specified in the compiler.
