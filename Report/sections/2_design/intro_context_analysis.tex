\section{Contextual Analysis} \label{chap:contextual_analysis}

This section will describe what happens in the next phase of a compiler, 
after the sourcecode has been parsed, which are contextual constraints.
The purpose of the contextual constraints is to give an informal 
specification of the scope and type rules, since the syntax rules by itself
are not enough to specify the format of a well-formed program. This section
will therefor describe what scope and type rules are, and what rules that have 
been specified in the compiler.
