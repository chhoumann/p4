\subsection{Context-Free Grammar Derivations}
There are two types of derivations; leftmost- and rightmost-derivations\cite{sebesta_concepts_2016}.

A \textit{leftmost derivation} is where the leftmost nonterminal symbol is replaced at each step of the derivation.

A \textit{rightmost derivation} is where the rightmost nonterminal is replaced at each step of the derivation.

Typically, bottom-up parsing algorithms use rightmost derivations in reverse. These are the LR parser and its variations. Likewise, most top-down parsers use leftmost derivations - this being the LL parser and its variations.
