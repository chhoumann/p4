\chapter{Implementation} \label{chap:implementation}
In order to implement \dazel{}, we will eventually need some kind of game engine for the game aspect.
For this, we chose the \textit{Unity} game engine\cite{technologies_unity_nodate} due to previous experience using it for 2D game projects.
Unity games are written in C\#, and consequently, we will also write the \dazel{} compiler in C\#.
