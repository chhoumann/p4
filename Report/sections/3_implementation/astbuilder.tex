\section{Building the Abstract Syntax Tree}

Following the parsing phase, and given that there are no errors in the source code that violate the syntax rules, the construction of the abstract syntax tree (AST) will begin. The construction of the AST is achieved through the use of a visitor pattern, more specifically, a technique called double dispatch. The benefit of using this technique is that it gives the ability to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate\cite{VisitorGuru}.
