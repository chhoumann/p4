  abstract  = {We present here an empirical study comparing the accuracy rates of novices writing software in three programming languages: Quorum, Perl, and Randomo. The first language, Quorum, we call an evidence-based programming language, where the syntax, semantics, and {API} designs change in correspondence to the latest academic research and literature on programming language usability. Second, while Perl is well known, we call Randomo a Placebo-language, where some of the syntax was chosen with a random number generator and the {ASCII} table. We compared novices that were programming for the first time using each of these languages, testing how accurately they could write simple programs using common program constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions, variables, parameters). Results showed that while Quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to those using Perl and Randomo, Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in K-12 education has flourished. In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research ({DBR}) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of {DBR}. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8â€“17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.},

However, students face many difficulties while learning the logic of computer programming, frequently failing in university courses. This Ph.D. research aims to identify difficulty patterns related to learning how to program, a crucial part of software engineers training. The research methodology comprises studies that put together results from a systematic literature review and empirical data collected from qualitative and quantitative studies. The difficulties identified will be compiled into a model, which may assist students in sharpening their focus, and teachers in preparing their lessons and teaching material, as well as researchers in employing methods and tools to support learning},
